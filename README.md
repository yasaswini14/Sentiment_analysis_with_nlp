dataset/ – Contains the dataset used for sentiment analysis (if applicable)

README.md – Project overview and instructions

🚀 Objective
To analyze customer reviews and classify their sentiment using:

TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction

Logistic Regression for modeling and classification

🔧 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

NLTK (for preprocessing)

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Steps Performed
Data Loading – Imported dataset of customer reviews
